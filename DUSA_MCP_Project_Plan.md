# DUSA_MCP: Decentralized Universal Server Architecture for Model Context Protocol

## Project Overview

DUSA_MCP is a Web3-enhanced platform for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that emphasizes creator recognition, contribution rewards, and decentralized governance. By integrating blockchain technology with the MCP ecosystem, DUSA_MCP creates a self-sustaining environment where all participants—creators, users, validators, and integrators—are properly recognized and rewarded for their contributions.

The platform leverages concepts from LazAI and Alith's decentralized AI architecture, adapting them specifically for the MCP server ecosystem. At its core, DUSA_MCP implements a 'bit' recognition system that aligns contributors, acts as reputation karma, and creates a self-perpetual loop of human-defined verification, feedback, and contribution.

## Core Principles

1. **Creator Sovereignty**: Creators maintain ownership and control over their MCP servers while benefiting from the network effects of the platform.

2. **Contribution Recognition**: All forms of contribution—from code to documentation to validation—are recognized and rewarded proportionally.

3. **Transparent Governance**: Platform decisions are made through transparent, token-based governance with multiple levels of participation.

4. **Verifiable Trust**: Trust in MCP servers is established through a combination of cryptographic verification and human consensus.

5. **Composable Value**: Value flows automatically when MCP servers are composed or integrated, with fair distribution to all contributors.
