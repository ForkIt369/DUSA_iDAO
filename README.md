# DUSA_MCP

**Decentralized Universal Server Architecture for Model Context Protocol**

## Vision

DUSA_MCP envisions a future where AI capabilities are democratized, interoperable, and aligned with human values through decentralized governance and fair value distribution. By bridging the Model Context Protocol with Web3 technologies, DUSA_MCP creates an ecosystem where creators, users, and contributors collaborate to build powerful, trustworthy, and accessible AI tools.

## Mission

To create a modular, interoperable platform that enhances the MCP ecosystem with Web3 capabilities, enabling transparent ownership, verifiable trust, and fair value distribution for all participants while fostering innovation through open standards and collaborative development.

## Core Features

- **Bit Recognition System**: A token-based system that aligns contributors, acts as reputation karma, and creates a self-perpetual loop of human-defined verification, feedback, and contribution
- **Modular Architecture**: Designed for seamless integration with LazAI, Alith, and other Web3/AI ecosystems
- **Verifiable Trust**: Trust in MCP servers established through a combination of cryptographic verification and human consensus
- **Decentralized Governance**: Platform decisions made through transparent, token-based governance with multiple levels of participation
- **Composable Value**: Value flows automatically when MCP servers are composed or integrated, with fair distribution to all contributors
