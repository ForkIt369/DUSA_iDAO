# DUSA_MCP

**Decentralized Universal Server Architecture for Model Context Protocol**

## Overview

DUSA_MCP is a Web3-enhanced platform for Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that emphasizes creator recognition, contribution rewards, and decentralized governance. By integrating blockchain technology with the MCP ecosystem, DUSA_MCP creates a self-sustaining environment where all participants—creators, users, validators, and integrators—are properly recognized and rewarded for their contributions.

## Core Features

- **Bit Recognition System**: A token-based system that aligns contributors, acts as reputation karma, and creates a self-perpetual loop of human-defined verification, feedback, and contribution
- **Creator Sovereignty**: Creators maintain ownership and control over their MCP servers while benefiting from the network effects of the platform
- **Verifiable Trust**: Trust in MCP servers is established through a combination of cryptographic verification and human consensus
- **Decentralized Governance**: Platform decisions are made through transparent, token-based governance with multiple levels of participation
- **Composable Value**: Value flows automatically when MCP servers are composed or integrated, with fair distribution to all contributors
