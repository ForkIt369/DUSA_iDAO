# Active Context: DUSA Meta-iDAO

## Current Tasks
- Establish and document the Memory Bank for project onboarding and continuity.
- Complete foundational documentation: project brief, product context, system patterns, tech context, progress.
- Prepare for Phase 1 development: core infrastructure, API gateway, MCP server registry, authentication, and onboarding flows.

## Recent Decisions
- Adopt concentric ring architecture for ecosystem orchestration.
- Use Bit Recognition Protocol and DAT tokenization for contribution and asset management.
- Prioritize MCP Initiative as the first incubated project.

## Immediate Next Steps
- Finalize and validate Memory Bank documentation.
- Begin implementation of core infrastructure and MCP server registry.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines and local development environments.
- Develop onboarding and contribution verification flows.

## Insights
- Clear, modular documentation is critical for onboarding new contributors and developers.
- Early focus on transparent recognition and reward mechanisms will drive community engagement.
- Cross-ecosystem compatibility (Alith, LazAI) is a strategic differentiator.

## Blockers / Clarifications Needed
- Awaiting finalization of governance and reputation-weighted voting mechanisms.
- Need to define detailed onboarding UX and DID integration flows.
- Clarify regulatory requirements for tokenized assets and cross-chain operations.
