# System Patterns: DUSA Meta-iDAO

## Architectural Overview

### Concentric Ring Architecture
- **Center (DUSA Meta-iDAO):** Orchestrates recognition, incubation, and alignment of iDAOs, AI agents, and value flows.
- **Inner Ring:** Human activation and creativity (Contributor Quadrant, DaVinci Recognition).
- **Middle Ring:** iDAO ecosystem, asset management, and tokenization (iDAO Quadrant, DAT Quadrant).
- **Outer Ring:** Secure infrastructure, verification, and trust (LazAI Quadrant, Verification Quadrant).

### Asset Hierarchy
- **Level 1:** DUSA Meta-iDAO (core governance, asset provenance, recognition, incentives).
- **Level 2:** Child iDAOs (specialized domains, independent governance, interoperable).
- **Level 3:** AI Agent Assets (domain-specific agents, tokenized, governed).
- **Level 4:** Supporting Asset Libraries (datasets, models, APIs, UX tools, cultural assets).

## Key System Patterns

- **Recognition & Reward:** Bit Recognition Protocol, portable reputation, progressive recognition, DAT tokenization, royalty distribution.
- **Contribution Framework:** Streams (Align, Alpha, Synergy, Karma), Pioneer Pathways (BitAction, BitQuest, AlphaDrop, AlphaJourney).
- **Governance:** Multi-level (meta, initiative, iDAO), reputation-weighted voting, decentralized treasury management.
- **Verification:** Human and AI-based verification, consensus protocols, quality assurance.
- **Incubation:** Standardized iDAO templates, resource allocation, mentorship, cross-iDAO collaboration.
- **Integration:** API gateways, cross-chain bridges, protocol adapters, external service connectors.

## Design Rationale

- **Human-Centric:** Prioritizes explicit recognition and economic participation for contributors.
- **Composable & Modular:** Supports rapid incubation and integration of new iDAOs and agents.
- **Transparent & Verifiable:** All value flows, contributions, and governance actions are on-chain and auditable.
- **Regenerative:** Continuous loop of contribution, recognition, and reward sustains ecosystem growth.
