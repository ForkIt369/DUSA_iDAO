# Product Context: DUSA Meta-iDAO

## Project Justification
- Traditional systems have long extracted value from individual contributors, obscuring and under-rewarding human creativity and effort.
- There is a need for transparent, equitable, and verifiable mechanisms that recognize, unlock, and reward the true value individuals bring to collaborative ecosystems.

## Problems Addressed
- Lack of explicit recognition and economic participation for diverse forms of human contribution.
- Centralized control and opaque value flows in digital and AI-driven ecosystems.
- Fragmented governance and siloed innovation across decentralized projects.

## User Goals
- Join and participate in a collaborative ecosystem as recognized stakeholders.
- Have contributions (data, ideas, expertise, culture) explicitly verified, tracked, and rewarded.
- Build portable reputation and governance influence across multiple iDAOs and initiatives.
- Benefit from transparent economic incentives and fair distribution of value created.
- Engage in community-driven innovation, governance, and cultural development.

## Value Proposition
- DUSA Meta-iDAO creates a regenerative loop where human and AI contributions are surfaced, recognized, and equitably rewarded.
- Contributors gain agency, ownership, and direct economic participation in the ecosystem's growth and success.
