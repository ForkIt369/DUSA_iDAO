# $REGRET Roulette: Gamified Speculative Rewards Mechanism

## Overview

$REGRET Roulette is a playful, social, speculative rewards mechanism that aligns early-stage contributions (BITS holders) with deeper, foundational value creation (DAT tokens), without diluting direct token rewards prematurely. It creates a gamified layer that enhances community engagement while preserving long-term economic incentives.

## Core Purpose

- **Bridge Speculation and Value Creation**: Reward speculative early engagement, incentivizing participation before tangible success
- **Build Community Culture**: Provide cultural, social, and gamified experiences that strengthen community bonds
- **Preserve Economic Incentives**: Maintain the integrity of long-term economic incentives via DAT tokens
- **Enable Sub-iDAO Customization**: Allow each sub-iDAO to create its own cultural identity through customized rewards

## Mechanics

1. **Earning Spins**:
   - BITS holders earn "Spins" at critical participation points
   - Spin opportunities tied to meaningful contributions and milestones
   - Progressive spin rewards for consistent participation

2. **Randomized Rewards**:
   - Spins provide randomized, engaging rewards
   - Reward categories include tokens, NFTs, social recognition, and cultural assets
   - Transparent, verifiable randomness through Chainlink VRF

3. **Sub-iDAO Customization**:
   - Each sub-iDAO can customize its own roulette wheel
   - Culture-specific rewards tied to community goals
   - Themed experiences that reinforce sub-iDAO identity

4. **Integration with Recognition System**:
   - Spins complement the BITS recognition system
   - Rewards amplify but don't replace core economic incentives
   - Social and cultural recognition enhances reputation
